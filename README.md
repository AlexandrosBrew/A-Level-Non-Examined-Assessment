# A-Level Non-Examined Assesment
Sign-Language Learning Platform by Alexandros Brew

This is a project I took on for my final non-examined assesment for my A-level, my aim was to create a website that allowed its users to create a basic understanding of british sign language so they can then find it easier to further advanced their fluency in such a language.
